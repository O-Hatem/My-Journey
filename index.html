# Welcome to my portifolio

Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist. I found my passion for data science and machine learning in college. And since then i decided to i want to beome one.

What i love about data science is the curiosity and the search for answers for demanding questions that can geniuly help people. Add this to my passion and love for exploration for answer to my questions, i think i found a career i'll never reget choosing.

I love and read in sociology and i find it intersiting to see how a society behave and how can a group of people (like in a company) take decisions. pairing that with the data science skills i have, i belive i can find some answers.
