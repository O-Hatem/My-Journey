    <p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/">Data Science and Machine Learning Udemy course.</a> (finished in about 3 months)</p>

    <p>Just today (Oct 25th, 2021), i almost the couse. It was very since and taught me how to write code for machine learning models with a small transefer learning model in the end.
I learned how to :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preprocess Data (Cleaning, Imputing, etc)</li>
      <li>Use Numpy, Pandas for accessing and  manipulating data in dataframes</li>
      <li>Use Matplotlib to visualize data and figure out how my model is performing</li>
      <li>Write an end-to-end machine learning models for regression and classification problems.</li>
      <li>Use TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub with Keras to build a transefer learning model</li>
    </ul>

    <p>but the course lackes the theortical part of machine learning and deep learning which is what i am looking to do next.</p>

<p>Andrew Ng Youtube playlist</p>

<p>Data Science from Scratch Book from O’reilly</p>

<ul>
  <li>I should not stop doing Kaggle comeptitions and should be coming up with my own ideas while taking a therotical course. I’ll feel discouraged to compelete the course if all i see is the math and equations. And to not forget the practical part.</li>
</ul>

  <li>(Oct 27<sup>th</sup>, 2021) After a little bit of thinking i decided to start with Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Playlist on YouTube. But before that, i’d like to review all the math needed to complete the course which include:
    <ul>
      <li>Linear Algebra</li>
      <li>Multi-variable calculas</li>
      <li>Probability and Statistics</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/home/">The Mathematics for Machine Learning Coursera course</a> covers the first two points plus PCA (principal component analysis). so after finishing it, i’ll search for a convinent course for probability and statistics for machine learning.</p>
