# Things I Need To Learn and Practice

## Python Library

1. datatable. a python library that help loads files into notebooks faster than doing it normally with `pd.read_csv()`. This a [link](https://github.com/vopani/datatableton) to sets, each represent a topic on the library.

1. gc. Python's garbage collector module.

1. category_encoders. More specific a coder named TargetEncoder

## Useful Concepts

1. Memory Reduction. For large datasets, Memor reduction is very useful in saving processing time. Found in [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mohammadkashifunique/single-xgboost-model-featureengineering/notebook)

1. Using manual cross validation functions.
