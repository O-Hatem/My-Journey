It was very since and taught me how to write code for machine learning models with a small transefer learning model in the end. I learned how to : . Preprocess Data (Cleaning, Imputing, etc) | Use Numpy, Pandas for accessing and manipulating data in dataframes | Use Matplotlib to visualize data and figure out how my model is performing | Write an end-to-end machine learning models for regression and classification problems. | Use TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub with Keras to build a transefer learning model | . but the course lackes the theortical part of machine learning and deep learning which is what i am looking to do next. . | Mathematics for Machine Leaning Coursea course . | What i’m looking to do next . Andrew Ng Youtube playlist . Data Science from Scratch Book from O’reilly . Notes . I should not stop doing Kaggle comeptitions and should be coming up with my own ideas while taking a therotical course. I’ll feel discouraged to compelete the course if all i see is the math and equations. And to not forget the practical part. | . Storytelling . (Oct 27th, 2021) After a little bit of thinking i decided to start with Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Playlist on YouTube. But before that, i’d like to review all the math needed to complete the course which include: Linear Algebra | Multi-variable calculas | Probability and Statistics | . The Mathematics for Machine Learning Coursera course covers the first two points plus PCA (principal component analysis). so after finishing it, i’ll search for a convinent course for probability and statistics for machine learning. . | .

            "content": "ML-related Questions . What is Cross Validation and what is it used for? . Cross Validation is a statstical way to predict the accuracy of a machine learning model. It helps reduce the change of overfitting to the data and selection bias. it’s used specially with small datasets where each data point may carry an important piece of information to help the machine learning model better predict. . Types of Cross Validation: . Classification has two main broad types: . non-Exhasutive Methods. non-Exhaustive method doesn’t compute all the ways of splitting data. . Holdout method. this method word by dividing the data into two sets, training and testing sets. Usually the percentage is 80:20 or 75:25 for training and testing respcetivly. . | K fold cross validation. it’s an improvment to the holdout method. it works by dividing the data into k folds, where training is performed on k-1 folds and testing is performed on 1 fold. then it chooses a different fold for testing while the rest for training, and so for till all folds are used as a testing fold once. Finally, it takes the average of all combination. . | Stratified K fold cross validation. There maybe a problem when using k fold CV when working on a classifcation problem. Where one fold can have a majority of a class resulting in selection bias for a particular fold. to prevent that stratified k CV is used to ensure that every fold consists balanced data between the class to avoid any bias in the data. . | | Exhaustive Methods. these are methods where is split the data into every possible combination of training and test sets. . Leave-P-out Method. it works by having p data points as the test set and (n-p) as the training set. where p will be every combination of the data points in the original dataset. The higher the p, the more combinations there are, the more processing power needed. . | Leave-one-out method. it is a variance of the Leave-p-out method where p is equal to 1. it is much less exhaustive where the number of combinations is euqal to n. . | | Rolling Cross validation. Rolling cross validation is used for time series datasets. It makes sure the golden rule of time series probelms (“look at the past to predict the future”) is not broken. it divides the data by a time frame and then train each split sequentially. e.g. . | Training set: [1], test set: [2] Training set: [1, 2], test set: [3] Training set: [1, 2, 3], test set: [4] . . Training set: [1, 2, 3, ..., n-1], test set: [n] .",
